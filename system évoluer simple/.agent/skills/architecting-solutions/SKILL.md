# Architecting Solutions

## When to use this skill
- When starting a new feature (Create Plan).
- When significantly refactoring code (Create Plan).
- When the user asks to "make a plan" or "architect a solution".
- When faced with a complex problem that requires a structured approach.

## Workflow
1.  **Analyze Request**: Understand the user's goal and context.
2.  **Draft High-Level Architecture**: Determine the approach, technologies, and major components.
3.  **Create Implementation Plan**: Use the `plan-template.md` to detail tasks step-by-step.
4.  **Review Plan**: Present the plan to the user for feedback.
5.  **Iterate**: Refine the plan based on user feedback.
6.  **Hand Off**: Once approved, hand off to execution (often `executing-plans` or manual execution).

## Instructions
- **Think Before Coding**: Do not write code until a plan is approved.
- **Detailed Tasks**: Break down work into small, verifiable steps (2-5 minutes each).
- **Format**: Use the provided template for consistency.
- **Verification**: Include a verification plan for each major step.
