# Brainstorming Ideas

## When to use this skill
- When the user has a vague idea ("I want to build a...")
- When requirements are unclear.
- When you need to explore potential solutions or trade-offs.
- Before starting a formal plan if there are open questions.

## Workflow
1.  **Gather Context**: Check existing files, docs, and recent work.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Use the `question-patterns.md` resource. Ask ONE question at a time to avoid overwhelming the user.
3.  **Propose Options**: Present 2-3 approaches with pros/cons.
4.  **Refine**: Iterate based on user feedback until a clear direction emerges.
5.  **Summarize**: State the agreed-upon direction clearly.
6.  **Next Step**: Suggest moving to `architecting-solutions` to create a plan.

## Instructions
- **Socratic Method**: Guide the user to the answer by asking questions.
- **Incremental**: Validate understanding frequently.
- **Multiple Choice**: Offer options rather than open-ended questions when possible.
- **Focus**: Keep the discussion on the "Why" and "What" before the "How".
