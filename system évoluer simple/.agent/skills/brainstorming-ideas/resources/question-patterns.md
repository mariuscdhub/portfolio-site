# Question Patterns for Brainstorming

When clarifying an idea, use these questions as starting points.

## Goal Clarification
- "What is the primary user goal?"
- "What problem are we trying to solve?"
- "Who is the target audience for this feature?"
- "What does success look like?"

## Scope Control
- "What is the MVP for this?"
- "Are there any hard constraints (time, technology, budget)?"
- "What features are explicitly *out of scope*?"

## Technical Constraints
- "Are there specific technologies we must use?"
- "Does this need to integrate with existing systems?"
- "Are there performance requirements?"

## User Experience
- "How should the user interact with this?"
- "What is the happy path?"
- "What happens when things go wrong (error states)?"

## Design & Aesthetics
- "Are there existing design patterns to follow?"
- "What is the desired tone/feel?"
