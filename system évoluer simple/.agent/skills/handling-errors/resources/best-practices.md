# Error Handling Best Practices

## Core Principles

1.  **Fail Fast**: Validate input early, fail quickly.
2.  **Preserve Context**: Include stack traces, metadata, and timestamps.
3.  **Meaningful Messages**: Explain what happened and how to fix it.
4.  **Log Appropriately**: Error = log, expected failure = don't spam logs.
5.  **Handle at Right Level**: Catch where you can meaningfully handle.
6.  **Clean Up Resources**: Use try-finally, context managers, defer.
7.  **Don't Swallow Errors**: Log or re-throw, don't silently ignore.
8.  **Type-Safe Errors**: Use typed errors when possible.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Catching Too Broadly**: `except Exception` hides bugs.
- **Empty Catch Blocks**: Silently swallowing errors.
- **Logging and Re-throwing**: Creates duplicate log entries.
- **Not Cleaning Up**: Forgetting to close files, connections.
- **Poor Error Messages**: "Error occurred" is not helpful.
- **Returning Error Codes**: Use exceptions or Result types.
- **Ignoring Async Errors**: Unhandled promise rejections.
